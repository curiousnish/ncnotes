***Disclaimer***

*This article reflects my thoughts and experience of pursuing Data Science. I am not a big fan of overly priced MOOCs or online courses and their promise of becoming a successful Data Scientist within months or weeks. Don’t get me wrong, these courses can help you with the basic idea of what is Data Science, and the technologies used but they will never be able to make you a master nor will you be able to get good high paying jobs based solely on these courses. The recruiters are not interested in courses you completed, but they are more interested in projects.*

In my opinion, if you want to master the art of Data Science, you must be able to dedicate a huge amount of time for practicing and trying different things out. You need a lot of motivation to get started but you need a greater amount of discipline to stay on the path of learning. I have a lot friends/colleagues who dropped the idea of pursuing Data Science because of no sudden benefits and lack of patience and discipline.

A quote by James Clear in [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) helped me a lot

> Success usually comes down to choosing the pain of discipline over the ease of distraction.

## What is Data Science


According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science),

> Data science is a “concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods” in order to “understand and analyze actual phenomena” with data.

In simple terms, **Data Science is the art of gaining insights from the data**. So to learn Data Science, you must know how to handle data, and the tools you’ll need to analyze and gain insights from the data.

## Roadmap

Following are the things you need to cover:

1.  Googling — Literally, How to google!
2.  Mathematics — Linear algebra, Basic Statistics, and Vectors and Matrices
3.  Programming
4.  Machine Learning/Data Science
5.  Visualization — Tableau or Power BI
6.  Projects and Journey ahead

Let’s start:

### 1\. Googling 😂

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Got a CV today and the guy literally listed one of his skills as ‘googling’ <br><br>We’re interviewing him</p>&mdash; Cat McGee (@CatMcGeeCode) <a href="https://twitter.com/CatMcGeeCode/status/1418592423865950212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Few days ago, I read a tweet from a recruiter stating that they are interviewing a candidate who mentioned “Googling” as one of the skills in his CV. Finding the best answers on internet will help you learn things faster and more efficiently than any online course. There are many people who have already had the same doubts as you in the past and the community is so vast and open minded that you can find answers to almost anything for free.

### 2\. Mathematics 😨

Don’t be afraid, we just need to know some basics to get started.

*   Linear algebra and Matrices— Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) YouTube Playlist from 3Blue1Brown.

That’s it, you can leave all the higher level concepts (calculus, differential equations) for the future (2 to 3 years).

### 3\. Programming — fun starts now! 🤩


There are mainly two programming languages that are common in the community for Data Science — Python and R. Each one has its own huge list of pros and cons. The main difference which helped me choose Python over R; “Python can be integrated well with Web Apps and Mobile Apps for easy deployment”.

*   For Python — Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_) YouTube Playlist from TheNewBoston, and read “[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)” book by Al Sweigart.

### 4\. Machine Learning — the best part 🎉


*   [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Stanford University and taught by Andrew Ng — The course uses Octave to teach programming concepts, but no one uses it these days. So to get most out of it, try to implement the same exercises in python.
*   Follow [Machine Learning Mastery blogs](https://machinelearningmastery.com/blog/).

### 5\. Visualization — cherry on the cake 🍰

Most of the end users and stakeholders don’t understand the different machine learning metrics (F1-score, Area under curve, True Positive and True Negatives, Mean Squared Error) but they properly understand graphs or Dashboards. So, a Data Scientist must be able put forward his insights in the form of Dashboards. There are mainly three tools used for this purpose:

*   Python Visualization — [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) or [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) (interactive)
*   [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) — My favorite and easy to learn.
*   [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) — More advanced Business Intelligence tool with too much flexibility and customization

To best way to learn any of these tools, find some Datasets and get started with visualizations. Also, there are very detailed documentations on each tool and vast community.

### 6\. Projects — move past tutorials 🐱‍🏍

Interviewers and companies want to see your work and the energy and knowledge you put in it, they are not interested in the courses. So after knowing the basics of Programming and Machine Learning you should get started with Projects, easy ones, like Housing Price Prediction, Simple Classification, etc.

This is just the beginning…

Hope this article helped you to get started with Data Science.

Best of luck!

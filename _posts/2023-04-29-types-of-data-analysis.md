Data always tells a story. But before it can be used to tell the story, it needs to be processed and make it usable to wield it into an engaging story. This article gives you an overview of different analytical components used to process the data into a story

## What is Data Analysis
Data analysis is the process of identifying, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover meaningful and useful information which can be presented as story through reports and presentations.

These stories can help in making business decisions that can help them in determining the impacts of their business, including evaluating customer sentiment, performing market and product research, and identifying trends or other data insights.

## Components of Analytics

Core components of analytics are divided into the following categories:

-   Descriptive Analytics 
    : What happened?
-   Diagnostic Analytics
    : Why did it happen?
-   Predictive Analytics
    : What might happen?
-   Prescriptive Analytics
    : What should we do next?
-   Cognitive Analytics
    : What inferences should we draw?

### Descriptive analytics

It helps answer questions about what has happened in the past based on historical data. The techniques include summarizing large datasets to describe outcomes of the past performance to stakeholders. It helps in providing the insights into current business performance, historical trends, strengths and weaknesses.

It includes developing key performance indicators (KPIs), that can help track the success or failure of key objectives. Metrics such as return on investment (ROI) are used in many industries, and specialized metrics are developed to track performance in specific industries.

Example: Generating reports to provide a view of an organization's sales and financial data in the past period.

### Diagnostic analytics

Diagnostic analytics help answer questions about why events happened. These techniques supplement basic descriptive analytics, by utilizing the findings from descriptive analytics to discover the cause of these events. Then, performance indicators are further investigated to discover why these events improved or became worse. Generally, this process occurs in three steps:

1.  Identify anomalies in the data. These anomalies might be unexpected changes in a metric or a particular market.
2.  Collect data that's related to these anomalies.
3.  Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends that explain these anomalies.

### Predictive analytics

Predictive analytics help answer questions about what will happen in the future. These techniques use historical data to identify trends and determine the likelihood of future outcomes using techniques like data mining, statistics, data modeling, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. These tools provide valuable insight into what might happen in the future. Techniques include a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques such as neural networks, decision trees, regression, clustering models and time-series models.

### Prescriptive analytics

Prescriptive analytics help answer questions about what actions should be taken to achieve a goal or target. By using insights from prescriptive analytics, organizations can make data-driven decisions and determine an optimal course of action. This technique allows businesses to make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty. Prescriptive analytics techniques rely on machine learning as one of the strategies to find patterns in large datasets. By analyzing past decisions and events, organizations can estimate the likelihood of different outcomes.

### Cognitive analytics

Cognitive analytics attempt to draw inferences from existing data and patterns, derive conclusions based on existing knowledge bases, and then add these findings back into the knowledge base for future inferences, a self-learning feedback loop. It helps one learn what might happen if circumstances change and determine how one might handle these situations.

Inferences aren't structured queries based on a rules database; rather, they're unstructured hypotheses that are gathered from several sources and expressed with varying degrees of confidence. Effective cognitive analytics depend on machine learning algorithms, and will use several natural language processing concepts to make sense of previously untapped data sources, such as call center conversation logs and product reviews.

<!-- ## Difference between Descriptive, Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics

| Comparison   | Descriptive                                                        | Predictive                                                                               | Prescriptive                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Summary**  | What Happened?                                                     | What's going to happen?                                                                  | What should Happen?                                                                                               |
| **Function** | Uses data mining and data aggregation to discover historical data. | Looks at all historical data and analyzes past data trends to predict what could happen. | Takes the conclusions gleaned from descriptive and predictive analytics and recommends the best course of action. |
| **Pros**     | Easy to employ in daily operations. Less experience is required.   | Valuable as a forecasting tool.                                                          | Offers critical insights into making the best data-driven decision.                                               |
| **Cons**     | Offers a limited view, and doesn't go beyond the data's surface.   | Needs lots of historical data to work. Will never be 100% accurate.                      | Requires lot of past data and often not accounts for all variables.                                               |

*So Similar yet So Different (Source: Author)*

This article won’t bore you with the stats of the most used programming language in a year or the languages that recruiters or companies prefer, because in order to get a great Data Science job, one must know both languages to some extent and really master one of the two.

This article will try to help you to choose the language to start with or the one to master.

## My Background

I started studying Machine Learning (ML) with no knowledge of programming and did a famous [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course by Andrew Ng which taught a lot of basics of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in simplified terms but the main drawback of the course is that it uses Octave (Open-source version of Matlab) for the programming exercises and no one uses it in the real world.

After a few weeks of studying the course, I came across two most famous programming languages used in the ML world namely Python and R. There were a lot of articles, YouTube videos and book references for the pros and cons of the 2 languages, but this article will help you choose the one to get started.

## Why I chose Python as starter.

After devoting long hours in the search for the best programming language I decided to go with Python and these were the reasons I chose it:

 1. Easy to read syntax and beginner friendly (every article started with this line)

 2. It has a huge library of packages (not a selling point, even R has a competitive set of packages)

 3. Can be used to create ML applications using Flask, Django, TensorFlow lite and Streamlit etc. (I’m sold)

I always wanted to make apps using Machine Learning and this was the main point of choosing Python as a starter.

## Verdict — What should you choose?

Different ML practitioners have different opinions on choosing the started language, but my suggestion would be to start with python as a starting point and try to learn the foundational concepts of Machine Learning. Later on, try to implement the learned concepts using R.

It is important to have a basic idea about both the languages as you will be working in teams and the language of choice will be decided based on the majority. Also, this will help you to learn some new concepts and techniques specific to the language.

## Bonus

Here’s a bonus tip on the choosing the language based on the role you are targeting. It is often noticed and experienced that R is preferred in the field of Research and Python for the rest of the use cases. So if you are trying to make a career in Research, then R may be a good choice otherwise start with Python.

What if I said that the path of becoming Productivity Master is being diverted to sell you stuff you never wanted.

You may have come across uncountable YouTube videos, plethora of online articles, blog posts, and unlimited amounts of books on the topic of Productivity.

You may also have also come around some buzzwords like Getting Things Done¬Æ (yes, it‚Äôs a registered trademark ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), Second Brain and many more which I might not have come around till now.

This is an article to showcase my experiences and learning while being trapped in these Productivity hacks and how I regained the control of my brain and led myself to independence (literally).

Let‚Äôs get right into the journey -

## 1. Getting¬†lost

This phase is the foundation that led me directly into the trap of Productivity World and different Gurus who tell you to do things in a certain way and the tools you‚Äôll need to reach your top ‚ÄúProductive Self‚Äù.

Before this phase, I was lost and developed so much backlogs in my work, my side hustles and projects and the worst part is these kind of backlogs can lead you to depression and might ruin you career. So I started searching for methods to improve my productivity and that let me to the Black-hole.

This backlog even extended to my gaming (ever increasing Steam library of games not even started üòÖ) because of all the work related backlogs. The infection started spreading ü¶†.

## 2. Finding the path leading to the destination (or so I¬†thought)

I stumbled upon thousands of resources online to get me to the Dream Land of ultimate Productivity and I was sure that I have been saved. I started with many different systems which required specific tools and software to get that sweet productivity feeling and I was sucked into the Black-hole.

After spending months trying to figure out different Productivity systems and combination of tools to improve my productivity, it was time to put it to test and get closer to the Dream Land. But after some time, reviewing my progress, although my documenting power increased as I noted every step and every detail of the work I needed to complete, but my backlog got worstüò≠.

And then came the worst part, instead of completing the work and reducing my backlogs, I started researching for some better productivity system and in doing so forgot the most important thing about productivity-

I started spending more time creating wonderful dashboards, databases (you get the notion of what I‚Äôm talking about ü§ê) and lastly encountering so many tools and their pros and cons.

## 3. Where‚Äôs the¬†Exit

After spending almost an eternity (at least that‚Äôs what it felt like) trying to customize my Productivity system, I figured that this was already done by our parents and their parents before that.

### Finding the Old School¬†Way

I researched for Productivity systems online but never looked in my home and how my parents were completing tasks along with their work and running the house. They used simple Pen and Paper to track their tasks and budget, physical calendar to track certain things like grocery and dairy products. I figured, what if, instead of getting another template for my new Productivity System, I utilize this old school method for once.

## 4. Independence Day

I can see the Exit door from the Productivity Black-hole I was trapped in and also had the drivers I would need to get through the door. It was an interstellar journey and I still don‚Äôt know whether I got out of it or is it just some another space-time illusion. But, my progress and the clearance of backlogs was certainly a positive indication of getting closer to that exit.

## Was it Worth¬†it!

Spending so much time figuring out the perfect Productivity System rather than completing my precious work led me to a situation full of stress and anxiety. I can definitely say one thing for sure that figuring out that perfect Productivity System appealed me so much that I forgot what it was actually meant to do for me. And don‚Äôt get me wrong, these systems do work if utilized correctly, that is using them to complete your work and stay on top of your schedule rather than focusing on figuring out new ‚Äúcutting edge‚Äù systems that proved to be beneficial for someone and might not work for you.

## Finally‚Ä¶

I have talked too much about what I did wrong and never even touched on the topic of what exactly I figured out that helped me clear all my backlogs and bring me back to tracks. So here we go‚Ä¶

1. I simply used a Free To-Do app (Gen Z) üòÖ; you can even use a simple notebook to note down the work that you need to complete that day or something that you need to focus during the week. Keep the horizon short, like a day or a week.
2. I used a Free calendar app to organize my day, week as required; only the task that were time-sensitive like scheduling a meeting, etc.
3. Lastly maintain a notebook, either physical or Free digital (again Gen Z), (Word and Google Docs were my choice when I could not find a physical notebook) to note down the roadblocks, learning and conclusion of the work, projects that you are focusing on.

This might not be different from the unlimited online resources that teach you about Productivity but the main ingredient missing is the time and money you waste in learning and customizing some new innovative tool when you can achieve the same thing with Free and simple to use tools and focus on the other important things like work and projects.

All of us have some kind of side hustles/projects that we want to be a part of our lives. It may include writing a book/blog, reading, learning, exercising and the list goes on. But due to our full time work/college life, we don‚Äôt always get time to invest in ourselves and work towards our goals.

I **used to wake up at 5 a.m.** during my childhood days, because our school started at 7 and my school bus would come at the stop at around 6 because the school was 12 kilometers away from my house and it took around 30 minutes to reach the destination. This was a start of a habit, I‚Äôm still grateful of.

But as I grew old, somethings changed and I was deprived of this habit and had to start new. For years, I had read about how people like Tim Cook, Benjamin Franklin, Richard Branson, Oprah and so many other highly successful people had one thing in common, **they woke up early**. All this motivated me to get back on track and make peace with my long lost habit.

Initial days were pretty rough. I would always think of getting up early in the morning while planning to sleep but something would **always** come up‚Ä¶

*   _I would stay up late playing games (‚Äú_**_Just one more game_**_‚Äù)_
*   _I was tempted by the snooze button (_**_Snooze gets the bigger, colored button_**_)_
*   _My bed was too warm and cozy._
*   _It was raining out (_**_we can‚Äôt win against nature_**_)._
*   _It was cold out (_**_the most loved thing is the blanket_**_)._
*   _It was hot out._
*   _And on and on and on‚Ä¶_

‚Ä¶and would sleep till half of the day is vanished üò¥.

Ugh.

So what changed?

How I found my way back to my old habit and made peace with the long lost love?

Here‚Äôs how I did it‚Ä¶

## Before Sleeping‚Ä¶

### 1. Go to bed early

Every article, video and podcast started with this line and I‚Äôm not really a fan of this. I **go to bed between 11 to 11:30** and this has never stopped me from getting up early. The important thing here to note is that I take 1 or 2 naps of around 20 minutes during the day which helps me focus and removes all the laziness during the work. Now this approach is not possible for everyone and may not work for others, but this is a game of experiment and try to schedule your day to get a good 7 to 8 hours of sleep.

If I was not able to take those precious naps during the day, then I would make sure to go to sleep at 10. So, you gotta try for yourself the different methods that your body can adapt to.

### 2. Create a Bedtime routine

The most crucial part of achieving this goal is to make a proper bedtime routine. Before going to sleep, you must do some routine work which will prepare your body and mind for the sleep that will be coming soon. Through trial and error, I found out some of the things that worked for me and it may work for you as well‚Ä¶

*   **Try to read some pages** of your favorite book, selecting a genre was the most important thing for me as I have imagination level similar to that of a child. I would create an imaginary world from the things described in the books so horror books are a big no for me. I would suggest reading motivational/personal development books, fictional comedy or autobiographies if you don‚Äôt want your mind to wake you up in the middle of night either scared or thinking about weird things.
*   **No screen time for 1 hour before** going to sleep (screens are the monsters that frighten our eyes from darkness)
*   **Don‚Äôt get into a fight** with partner or family members or be in an angry mood before sleeping as it will distract your mind towards the things you would have done differently that would have avoided this situation
*   **Don‚Äôt eat right before going to bed** as will create different types of problems other than ruining your sleep. If we continue to sleep right after eating, we tend to gain weight and our health deprecates faster (a big no for those trying to lose weight)
*   **No News** before bed **AT ALL COSTS.** During pandemic, all news channels were covered with deaths, tension, uncertain future and so on. News is an important part of our lives, but it‚Äôs not helpful before going to bed. Sometimes, I had woken up in the middle of night covered in sweat with a heart rate of about 100‚Äì120 bpm to a nightmare of seeing my loved ones disappear from my lives (try to avoid bad news before sleeping)

Lastly, try to think of all the things, projects or activities that you will be doing the next morning after getting up early. Make a list, write on a post-it note, do whatever it takes to get you motivated to move out of the bed.

### 3. Waking Up (The most difficult part) and way ahead

It is the most painful part and it has the highest Failure Rate for obvious reasons üòâ.

I have always found myself getting up early because of the things I planned to do in the morning and the level of satisfaction it will grant. I would build projects, write code, study data science, write blogs, go for cycling, exercise and the list goes on increasing. Try to find the things you love and will help you grow and try to complete them in the morning.

After getting up, try to move as soon as possible, get out of bed, find some water, heat it (drinking warm water in the morning is the most healthiest thing) and Get Things Doneüòé!

And, before you know it, it will be time to go to bed again.

Good Luck üëç!
